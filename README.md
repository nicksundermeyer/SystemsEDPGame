A small game project created in Unity for my Systems in EDP class. 
This is a coop game with gravity manipulation mechanics. Each of the two players may move on either the top or bottom of the center of the screen, with gravity switching on passing the center line. They use this mechanic to switch sides and help each other to progress forward.
